     * considered the **next** state.
     *
     * The base implementation only supports plain object actions. If you want
     * to dispatch a Promise, an Observable, a thunk, or something else, you
     * need to wrap your store creating function into the corresponding
     * middleware. For example, see [Epic]

     *   idea to keep actions serializable so you can record and replay user
     *   sessions

     * Note that, if you use a custom middleware, it may wrap [dispatch]`.
